period 1
I was alittle late to first period because the train was delayed and the bus was running late. When I arrived to school I missed first period so I just went to second period. After a few hours, lunch came around and my friends and I decided to go eat at Marianos. I got some macaroni and cheese with chicken and a few butterfly shrimp. I went back inside the school and waited for the end of the day to come.
